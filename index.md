## Welcome to TagLok

Introducing TagLok! A project to make NFC based locking systems cheap and easy!

### How it Works

TagLok harnesses the power of Arduino and the PN532 NFC chip to provide a proof-of-concept locking system for car doors. It can be made to work in one of five ways

1. TagLok can directly power door lock actuators to lock/unlock doors
2. TagLok can emit an RF code that emulates an existing keyless entry fob to lock/unlock doors
3. TagLok can power an existing RF keyfob that can already lock/unlock doors
4. TagLok can be used to start/stop a car without the use of the key
5. TagLok can be used as a secondary, active anti-theft system by preventing ignition unless the tag is present.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/taglok/taglok-site/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
